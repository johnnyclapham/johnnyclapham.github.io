      <p>
        I am a Computer Science MS graduate student at The College of William and Mary looking for internship
        opportunities
        in software engineering for the summer of 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current research interests involve Ubiquitous Mobile Computing (UMC), as well as
        Computer-Human Interaction (CHI). I am a resilient and fast learner who can adapt and work
        well in a team-based environment. I am able to work on problems at any level of the
        development stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would very much appreciate the opportunity to be able to meet and discuss what skills I
        can bring to the team at your company.
      </p>
