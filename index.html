    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science MS graduate student at The College of William and Mary looking
      for internship opportunities in software engineering for the summer of 2022.
    </p>
      My current research interests involve Ubiquitous Mobile Computing (UMC), as well as
      Computer-Human Interaction (CHI). I am a resilient and fast learner who can adapt and work
      well in a team-based environment. I am able to work on problems at any level of the
      development stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would very much appreciate the opportunity to be able to meet and discuss what skills I
      can bring to the team at your company.
